//check for 'keydown' events. If the user enters this special code,
//pressing all ten of the keys in the correct order,
//alert() a congratulatory message. However,
//if they press a key out of sequence or a key that isn't part of the Konami code,
//don't alert() anything and
//simply keep listening for all ten keydowns in the correct order.

//When you're testing the code out in the browser,
//be sure to call init() to attach the event listener and set everything up!
